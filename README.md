Bank App Clone is a project that imitates a working bank and implements the following features:
* Login capability
* Funds transfer between accounts
* Loan request
* Account closure
* Logging out after 5 mins of inactivity

You can view the live demonstration here: https://bank-app-clone-two.vercel.app/

It was built entirely using array and array methods including the login feature.
I used the Internationalization API to set the date and account balance currency.
