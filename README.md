Bank App Clone is a project that imitates a working bank and implements the following features:
* Login capability
* Funds transfer between accounts
* Loan request
* Account closure
* Logging out after 5 minutes of inactivity

You can view the live demonstration here: https://bank-app-clone-two.vercel.app/

It was built entirely using array and array methods including the login feature.
I used the Internationalization API to set the date and account balance currency.

Login details:
account 1: {username: ta, pin: 1111}
account 2: {username: ys, pin: 2222}
account 3: {username: pe, pin: 3333}
account 4: {username: au, pin: 4444}
account 5: {username: cn, pin: 5555}
